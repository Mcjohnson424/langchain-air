# Plan-and-Execute Agent

This example shows how to use an agent that uses the Plan-and-Execute framework to answer a query.
This framework works differently from the other currently supported agents (which are all classified as Action Agents) in that it uses a two step process:

1. First, the agent uses an LLM to create a plan to answer the query with clear steps.
2. Once it has a plan, it uses an embedded traditional Action Agent to solve each step.

The idea is that the planning step keeps the LLM more "on track" by breaking up a larger task into simpler subtasks.
However, this method requires more individual LLM queries and has higher latency compared to Action Agents.

**Note**: This agent currently only supports Chat Models.
