# Additional Functionality: Chat Models

We offer a number of additional features for chat models. In the examples below, we'll be using the `ChatOpenAI` model.

## Additional Methods

LangChain provides a number of additional methods for interacting with chat models:

## Streaming

Similar to LLMs, you can stream responses from a chat model. This is useful for chatbots that need to respond to user input in real-time.

## Adding a timeout

By default, LangChain will wait indefinitely for a response from the model provider. If you want to add a timeout, you can pass a `timeout` option, in milliseconds, when you call the model. For example, for OpenAI:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TimeoutExample}</CodeBlock>

## Cancelling requests

You can cancel a request by passing a `signal` option when you call the model. For example, for OpenAI:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CancellationExample}</CodeBlock>

Note, this will only cancel the outgoing request if the underlying provider exposes that option. LangChain will cancel the underlying request if possible, otherwise it will cancel the processing of the response.

## Dealing with Rate Limits

Some providers have rate limits. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll get an error. To help you deal with this, LangChain provides a `maxConcurrency` option when instantiating a Chat Model. This option allows you to specify the maximum number of concurrent requests you want to make to the provider. If you exceed this number, LangChain will automatically queue up your requests to be sent as previous requests complete.

For example, if you set `maxConcurrency: 5`, then LangChain will only send 5 requests to the provider at a time. If you send 10 requests, the first 5 will be sent immediately, and the next 5 will be queued up. Once one of the first 5 requests completes, the next request in the queue will be sent.

To use this feature, simply pass `maxConcurrency: <number>` when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ maxConcurrency: 5 });
```

## Dealing with API Errors

If the model provider returns an error from their API, by default LangChain will retry up to 6 times on an exponential backoff. This enables error recovery without any additional effort from you. If you want to change this behavior, you can pass a `maxRetries` option when you instantiate the model. For example:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ maxRetries: 10 });
```

## Subscribing to events

Especially when using an agent, there can be a lot of back-and-forth going on behind the scenes as a Chat Model processes a prompt. For agents, the response object contains an intermediateSteps object that you can print to see an overview of the steps it took to get there. If that's not enough and you want to see every exchange with the Chat Model, you can pass callbacks to the Chat Model for custom logging (or anything else you want to do) as the model goes through the steps:

For more info on the events available see the [Callbacks](/docs/production/callbacks/) section of the docs.
