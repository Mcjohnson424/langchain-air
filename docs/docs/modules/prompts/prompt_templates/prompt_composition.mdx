# Prompt Composition

Pipeline prompt templates allow you to compose multiple individual prompt templates together.
This can be useful when you want to reuse parts of individual prompts.

Rather than taking `inputVariables` as an argument, pipeline prompt templates take two new arguments:

- `pipelinePrompts`: An array of objects containing a string (`name`) and a `PromptTemplate` passed in as `promptTemplate`.
  Each `PromptTemplate` will be formatted and then passed to the next prompt template in the pipeline as an input variable with the same name as `name`.
- `finalPrompt`: The final prompt that will be returned.

Here's an example of what this looks like in action:

import Example from "@examples/prompts/pipeline_prompt.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
