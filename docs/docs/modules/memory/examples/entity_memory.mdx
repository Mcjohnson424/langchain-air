# Entity Memory

Entity Memory remembers given facts about specific entities in a conversation.
It extracts information on entities (using an LLM) and builds up its knowledge about that entity over time (also using an LLM).

## Usage:

import Example from "@examples/memory/entity.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

### Inspecting the Memory Store

You can also inspect the memory store directly to see the current summary of each entity:

import MemoryInspectionExample from "@examples/memory/entity_memory_inspection.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MemoryInspectionExample}</CodeBlock>
