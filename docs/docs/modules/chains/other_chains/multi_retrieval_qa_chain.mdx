# `MultiRetrievalQAChain`

MultiRetrievalQAChain enables an LLM to select from multiple retrievers. Construct the chain by providing a collection of vector stores (as retrievers) along with their corresponding names and descriptions. The chain takes a query as input, picks an appropriate retrievers, and subsequently feeds the input into the chosen retrievers.
